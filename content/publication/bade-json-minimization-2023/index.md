abstract: "In this project, we present a novel approach to simplify the debugging process for developers working with large JSON lines data. Our solution involves the creation of a program that iteratively reduces the size of the JSON lines file by removing the JSON objects which are not responsible for the error, providing developers with a more manageable subset of the data. By progressively minimizing the input, we aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of debugging procedures significantly, ultimately streamlining the development workflow."
