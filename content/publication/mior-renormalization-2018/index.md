abstract: "NoSQL applications often use denormalized databases in order to meet performance goals, but this introduces complications as the database itself has no understanding of application-level denormalization. In this paper, we describe a procedure for reconstructing a normalized conceptual model from a denormalized NoSQL database. The procedureâ€™s input includes functional and inclusion dependencies, which may be mined from the NoSQL database. Exposing a conceptual model provides application developers with information that can be used to guide application and database evolution."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
