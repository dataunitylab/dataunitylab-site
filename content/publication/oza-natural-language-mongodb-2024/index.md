abstract: "Natural Language Interfaces is an evolving research area, aimed at learning and contextualizing the natural language processing for human computer interaction systems. With the advances in natural language processing (NLP) with machine learning, many significant systems have been built to understand and process human language and provide the necessary output in terms of code or database queries. Few of these systems which are remarkable are based upon works of the Transformer and its attention mechanism. Our project works on one such system, where we convert natural language queries to MongoDB queries."
